ðŸ“Š Project Title: Optimal Clustering using K-Means and the Elbow Method
Description:
This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning, aiming to identify inherent groupings within a dataset. By utilizing the Elbow Method, we determine the optimal number of clusters by evaluating the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different values of k.

The steps include:

Preprocessing and visualizing the input dataset.

Iteratively applying K-Means with k values from 1 to 10.

Recording WCSS to observe the rate of reduction with increasing clusters.

Plotting an Elbow Curve to identify the ideal number of clusters.

Final model training and visual representation of clusters.

This approach is particularly useful for segmenting data in fields like marketing, customer analysis, biology, and more, where the true labels are unknown.
